# SOPA WALL - Auto-Censor your web site

SOPA WALL is an embeddable auto-censorship wall made of tweets protesting against SOPA and PIPA.

SOPA WALL, collects tweets with the #SOPA hashtag and shows them on top of a web page, to simulate the creation of a censorship wall. It's harmless to the web page that embeds it and the user can easily remove it by clicking the "close" button on top right.

You can easily add SOPA WALL to your website by adding these lines of code to any web page:

``` html
<script src="http://www.makinguse.com/sopawall/sopawall.min.js"></script>
```

SOPA WALL is a super simple experiment. Nothing fancy.

Feel free to download, fork and modify it.
